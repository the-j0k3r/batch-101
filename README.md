### About - Simple Shredder

This small batch file, leverages the power of SDelete in order to shred files or folders dragged and dropped onto the Simple Shedder icon.

Simple Shredder is menu driven and offers a few options, at this time, it allows the user to decide between 2 to 6 passes that SDelete will use to shred your files into oblivion, likely for all time :).

Once you download and extract the SDelete binaries into the Simple Shredder directory, you're set to go. Simple Shredder automatically uses the correct SDelete binary bitness 32-bit/64-bit which is system dependant.

Just drag and drop Files or Folders and their contents onto the Simple Shredder icon to begin. Simple
