## About - Simple Shredder

Simple Shredder is menu driven and offers a few options, at this time, it allows the user to decide between 2 to 6 or a custom number of passes that SDelete will use to shred your files into oblivion, likely for all time :).

Once you download and extract the SDelete binaries into the Simple Shredder directory, you're set to go. Simple Shredder automatically uses the correct SDelete binary bitness 32-bit/64-bit which is system dependant.

Just drag and drop Files or Folders and their contents onto the Simple Shredder icon to begin. Simple!
